# AddLocale
Copy'n paste translation result from following english text.

```
Stereo test
Left|Right
```

"Left|Right" is because no language use "|" in common sentense, and to make translator understand "Left" and "Right" is the direction, not "correct" or "leave".

# VoiceSynth 
## LeftRight
Make "Left" and "Right" voice .wav. It's windows's voice. A litttle sad.
## LeftRight.WPF
This is to make the YouTube video. It can play and record the timing you pushed the button. I mean, this is the basic sampler.  
But I didn't use this after all. It doesn't sounds as good. I used Audacity instead.
